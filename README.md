# 📊 Analysis Projects

Welcome to the **Analysis Projects** repository!  
This space is dedicated to showcasing my personal and professional projects focused on data analysis, data mining, and data visualization using Python and related tools.

Each folder contains a self-contained project with code, datasets, and insights drawn from real-world data.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository helps me keep track of projects where I dive into datasets, clean and explore them, extract insights, and sometimes apply basic modeling. These projects are designed to:

* Enhance analytical thinking  
* Sharpen Python and data wrangling skills  
* Build a strong portfolio for data-focused roles  
* Tell stories with data using code-first visualizations
